<h2>Angular Quiz App</h2>

<p>Hey everyone! üéâ</p>
<p>I'm really excited to share the Angular quiz app I've been working on! It's all about Angular and built entirely using Angular, and I would love for you to check it out <a href="https://angular-10-quiz-app.stackblitz.io/">here</a>.</p>
<p>This dynamic and interactive quiz application is designed to present users with a series of questions across various milestones. It features timed quizzes, multiple-answer and single-answer questions, as well as explanations for each question. The app allows you to take engaging quizzes, navigate between questions smoothly, and provide real-time feedback based on your answers. The app is still a work in progress, with ongoing refinements to functionality, performance optimization, and a few features still under development.</p>
