QUIZ TODO:
- navigating to next question -- get working, make sure button is pressable only once so questionID is incremented only once
- timer not working in quiz app in IntelliJ and in StackBlitz
- display correctAnswerText for messages - get value from the QuizService and the databinding should pick it up
- show the correct option number(s) in explanation 
	(databinding not working to fetch in the form and DI component (try console.logging))
- show correct options in messages below options

- should say "The correct answer is/are Option 1 (and Option 2)." (IN PROGRESS)
  - basically done, need databinding to work

- if wrong answer is picked before correct, it says "That's wrong" without saying what the correct options are
- if no answer is selected after time expires, show correct answer with explanation (work on) with quiz delay (done) and then move to the next q (done)

- once navigation works, check that progressbar increments for next question
- once navigation works, check that correctAnswerCount is incremented
- once navigation works, make sure there is clearing of options in between questions
- once navigation works, make sure border is blue for question and gray for answers

- remove selected in the interface and make adjustments to the app
- also questions without id in interface
- mat-checkbox for multiple answer questions (if there is a single answer use mat-radio otherwise use mat-checkbox), created function in API to check the question type

- change the quiz-topic-img instead to use the image path in QUIZ_DATA <img mat-card-image [src]="quizData.imageUrl"> instead of loading it in the CSS

- answer showing up as error in di-quiz template - answer is not a field on model! - check if this is still an issue
- fix the selected error .selected vs ['selected']

- create function that creates a mapping - I believe I've done this
	- loop over q array
	- if option is correct, need to store the option in an array
	- if the question has more than one option that is correct
		- have a multiple variable set to true and push the additional options after
		- have a mapping between q # and correct answer(s)

- use only one class in section id 

- display of next question text should be in template - no DOM!

- disable next btn in DI component
- displaying checkmark and x's in the same position from the right of the option box (already done, but maybe it can be done w/o position: absolute?)

- for last question, make sure that the correct answer is selected and time stopped
- after answering last question it should forward to Results and mat-card should display

- work on Results Component, passing the data from DI Component/services to the Results
	- just pass 2 values to resultscomponent
	- make sure percent and completion time display
	- show your results button not navigating to results - should never exceed the totalQuestions
	- make sure mat-accordion works
	- have a correctness bar in the results: show the %, then the bar, then the score 2/8
	- fb button bonus!

- make a cool hover effect on options
- animated next button when moving to next question?
- previous btn???


Get the app working 100% correctly, then work on RxJS/NgRx!!!
