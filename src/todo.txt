QUIZ TODO:
- fix the options error in chrome dev tools
- navigating to next question -- get working, make sure button is pressable only once so questionID is incremented only once
- progressbar increment for next question
- incrementing CORRANS
- why is clear mat-icon not working?

option index

create function that creates a mapping?
loop over q array
if option is correct, need to store the option in an array
if the question haore than one option that is correct, have a more than one variable set to true and push the additional options after
have a mapping between q # and correct answer(s)

add more q's to the quiz.ts file
make sure the app works w/o QuestionIndex in the model
todo: have to rewrite app so it works w/ the correct boolean answer - should be like a map btwn correct bool answer "true" and correct option #
need to determine how the questionIndex from allQ array

make sure it works w/o selected and also questions w/o index

if more than 1 ans, opts 1 and 2 are correct. tricky???
Should say The correct answer is/are Option 1 (and Option 2).

if no answer is selected after time expires, should I show correct answer w/ explanation for couple sec and then move to the next q?

wrong message not being shown

[Honeybadger] Unable to send error report: no API key has been configured.

- not clearing btwn questions
- explanation not showing up when any answer is selected (maybe need to use a toggleExplanation variable here! if the question has answer, set toggleExpl true otherwise false)

- for last question, make sure that the correct answer is selected and time stopped
- after answering last question it should forward to results and results mat-card should display...

next questions not showing up with blue border
questionText undef on last q


completion time not displaying
percent not being shown either
show your results btn not navigating to results - should never exceed the totalQuestions

mat-accordion not working

Cannot read property 'questionText', totalQuestions of undefined on last q
fb button bonus!

if the next btn is clicked w/ no answers selected, show the correct answer and move on to the next

have a correctness bar in the results: show the %, then the bar, then the score 2/8

move functions around after and somehow get it to work - In Progress

make a cool hover effect on options

-------------------------------------------
- disp next quetsion text should be in template - NO DOM
- just pass 2 values to resultscomponent
- just use one class in section id
